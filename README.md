# Mac Starter 

![Tests](https://github.com/rvignesh89/mac-starter/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

I usually love to tear down my laptop from time to time and re-install everything. I don't know why but I'd like to keep my setup clean and lean. And I find it easy to just start from scratch rather than figuring out what is installed and keep cleaning them. 

Recently I realised that I'm doing mundane things of re-installing applications which was not fun. So I wanted to automate the whole process and this repository contains the scripts needed to do that.

## Goal

I'd like to reach a state where after setup a new Macbook I just download script from Github and run it and go make a cup of coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and come back to see everything that I need ready. It should look something like at the end.

## Software

I use my Mac mainly for development and playing some games on Steam. So it's going to be minimal setup with contains the following softwares.

- Homebrew
- Google Chrome
- Rectangle
- iTerm2
- Visual Studio Code
- Spotify 
- Notion
- Microsoft Teams
- Zoom
- Team Viewer
- Onedrive
- Yammer
- IntelliJ

## Development Environment

- Docker
- Java
- Go
- gradle
- Oh-My-Zsh
- SSH keys
- nvm

## Command Line

- jq 

## OSX Settings

I've changed the following behaviours in OSX

- Change tap to press - By default I need to press to press üôÑ
- Show only active items in dock - I don't like clutter.
- Increase keyrepeat and delay keyrepeat delay - I assume most devs like it this way.
- Add bottom right corner as hot corner for locking screen

# Mac App Store

I'm using [mas-cli](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) to automate installation for the following apps. This installation uses ids listed in `mas search <app>` command to ensure the correct app is installed. It also skips installation if the app is already present.

- iMovie

## Future work.

- Programming languages & frameworks like Python, Golang, .NET Core.

There is some level of automation which might be possible but I've not attempted to do it, like extensions in Chrome. Maybe something that I might attempt sometime in the future.
